                <h3>Mastermind</h3>
                <p>This is my take on the classic paper and pencil game: Mastermind. I built this to practice JS listeners and it 
                    quickly became my testing ground for git and GitHub. It is still is an early phase; feel free to check it out and 
                    offer any suggestions or general advice.<p>

                <h3>My Music Page</h3>
                <p>This is my landing page as a professional musician. I haven't updated content it in a couple years, let alone the style and 
                    functionality. I would like to do a full reboot of this page when I have time.<p>
            </li>

            <li class="card">
                <h3>Louisville Jazz Initiative</h3>
                <p>This is the website for the Louisville Jazz Initiative, a non profit organization I co-founded in April 2021. We are 
                    a collective of jazz musicians in Louisville, KY committed to culturally authentic playing and teaching of jazz music. 
                    This is a brand new organization so the website lacks media; with many upcoming events though, that will soon change.<p>

                <h3>Test Card</h3>
                <p>This card will exist temporarily as a fourth card to test the slide functionality. Ideally, this card will not show normally 
                    and will require the scroll to view.<p>
