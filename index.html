                <p>This is my take on the classic paper and pencil game: Mastermind. I built this to practice JS listeners and it 
                    quickly became my testing ground for git and GitHub. It is still is an early phase; feel free to check it out and 
                    offer any suggestions or general advice. Check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/csobrien90/mastermind" target="_blank">here</a>.<p>

                <p>This is the website for the Louisville Jazz Initiative, a non profit organization I co-founded in April 2021. We are 
                    a collective of jazz musicians in Louisville, KY committed to culturally authentic playing and teaching of jazz music. 
                    This is a brand new organization so the website lacks media; with many upcoming events though, that will soon change.<p>

                <p>This is my landing page as a professional musician. I haven't updated content it in a couple years, let alone the style and 
                    functionality. I would like to do a full reboot of this page when I have time.<p>
