                <h3><a href="http://louisvillejazzinitiative.com" target="_blank">Louisville Jazz Initiative</a></h3>
                <p>This is the website for the Louisville Jazz Initiative, a non profit organization I co-founded in April 2021. We are 
                    a collective of jazz musicians in Louisville, KY committed to culturally authentic playing and teaching of jazz music. 
                    This is a brand new organization so the website lacks media; with many upcoming events though, that will soon change.<p>

                <p>This is the website for Fiber Coven, a weekly witchy themed podcast about the knitting, spinning, and everything fiber 
                    related. Check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/csobrien90/fiber-coven" target="_blank">here</a>.<p>

                <h3><a href="https://csobrien90.github.io/mastermind" target="_blank">Mastermind</a></h3>
                <p>This is my take on the classic paper and pencil game: Mastermind. I built this to practice JS listeners and it 
                    quickly became my testing ground for git and GitHub. The game is officially functional which is very exciting! 
                    That said, it is still in an early phase and not styled in any way. Feel free to check it out, play to your hearts 
                    content (it's pretty addicting!) and offer any suggestions or general advice. Check out the repo

                <p>I made this page to learn more about manipulating iframe elements. It displays some of my favortie 
                    daily web comics. My initial plan with this page is to learn how to make iframes more responsive and with dynamic 
                    sizing. The long term goal is to include a tool that allows you to preview a new comic's site with a rectangle 
                    that can be moved over the comic, resized to crop the comic, and output the numbers needed to add that comic to the 
                    page. Check out the repo

                <p>This is my landing page as a professional musician. I haven't updated content it in a couple years, let alone the style and 
                    functionality. I would like to do a full reboot of this page when I have time.<p>
